### HarvardX CS109x - Introduction to Data Science with Python

Repository created to store the codes I wrote and studies carried out during the **Introduction to Data Science with Python** course taught by Harvard/Edx.

It's important to note that all the code written was adapted from some of the exercises to expand on the concepts I studied during each section. Therefore, most of the code will not correspond to the correct answers to the course exercises, and I wrote them for educational purposes only.
